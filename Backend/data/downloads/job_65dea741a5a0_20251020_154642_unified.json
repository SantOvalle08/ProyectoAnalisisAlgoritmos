    "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid digital development of the recent era has revolutionized the overall network of business and management as well as other sectors. The book discusses how emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data analytics, cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), have a high level of impact on different industries. With more and more businesses turning towards these techs, it is extremely important to really understanding their relation and use in order to remain at the cutting edge of technology while emerging as an innovator. Chapter 1 is a detailed introduction to the digital transformation, driven by AI, blockchain, IoT and other technologies are changing Business &amp; Management processes. This paves the way for diving deeper into targeted topics where these innovations are starting to have a big influence. In chapter two we delve into the increasing popularity of generative AI, ChatGPT takes center stage and how it is impacting range of industries. In this research, we review generative AI applications and opportunities as well as challenges and the outlook, for future development. Also touched on in the book are the customer front-exporting portions of digital renovation. Chapter 3 - Overall Vision: How AI, Machine Learning and related technologies help in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty right into the services industry to build exceptional service quality.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Frontiers of Artificial Intelligence Versus Generative, Explainable and Quantum Technologies: An Overview",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Generative AI can produce content that is similar to human ingenuity, revolutionizing a number of industries with lifelike outputs like music and images. Misinformation and intellectual property rights give rise to ethical concerns. Notwithstanding these difficulties, generative AI has the potential to spur additional innovation in a variety of sectors, subject to moral issues. The goal of explainable AI (XAI) is to improve AI systems’ accountability and transparency, which is essential for their inclusion into industries like banking and healthcare. However, in order to effectively explain complicated AI systems, strong XAI techniques are required. Quantum artificial intelligence (QAI) promises improvements in cryptography and optimization by using quantum physics to speed up AI systems. However, there are still difficulties in creating practical quantum computers and improving quantum AI algorithms. The present overview provides new insights into developing a platform to explore AI in various arenas of life sciences and technologies and social up-gradation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid advancements of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies, such as the well-known OpenAI ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, have sparked significant societal, economic, and regulatory challenges. Indeed, while the latter technologies promise unprecedented productivity gains, they also raise several concerns, such as job loss and displacement, deepfakes, and intellectual property violations. The present article aims to explore the present regulatory landscape of GenAI across the major global players, highlighting the divergent approaches adopted by the United States, United Kingdom, China, and the European Union. By drawing parallels with other complex global issues such as climate change and nuclear proliferation, this paper argues that the available traditional regulatory frameworks may be insufficient to address the unique challenges posed by GenAI. As a result, this article introduces a resilience-focused regulatory approach that emphasizes aspects such as adaptability, swift incident response, and recovery mechanisms to mitigate potential harm. By analyzing the existing regulations and suggesting potential future directions, the present article aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how to effectively govern GenAI technologies in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.</jats:p>",

    "title": "A Survey of Generative Artificial Intelligence Techniques",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) refers to algorithms capable of creating novel, realistic digital content autonomously. Recently, generative models have attained groundbreaking results in domains like image and audio synthesis, spurring vast interest in the field. This paper surveys the landscape of modern techniques powering the rise of creative AI systems. We structurally examine predominant algorithmic approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and autoregressive models. Architectural innovations and illustrations of generated outputs are highlighted for major models under each category. We give special attention to generative techniques for constructing realistic images, tracing rapid progress from early GAN samples to modern diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. The paper further reviews generative modeling to create convincing audio, video, and 3D renderings, which introduce critical challenges around fake media detection and data bias. Additionally, we discuss common datasets that have enabled advances in generative modeling. Finally, open questions around evaluation, technique blending, controlling model behaviors, commercial deployment, and ethical considerations are outlined as active areas for future work. This survey presents both long-standing and emerging techniques molding the state and trajectory of generative AI. The key goals are to overview major algorithm families, highlight innovations through example models, synthesize capabilities for multimedia generation, and discuss open problems around data, evaluation, control, and ethics. Please let me know if you would like any clarification or modification of this proposed abstract.</jats:p>",

Technical and vocational higher education institutions (TVHEIs), whose mission is to prepare students for the labor market, face a dual challenge: on the one hand, they must train human capital capable of understanding and using AI in professional contexts; on the other, they must internally adapt to this technology by redesigning teaching, administrative, and outreach processes. Generative AI is no longer a promise of the future. According to McKinsey (2025), 78% of surveyed organizations already use AI in at least one function, and 71% regularly employ generative AI. This indicates that advanced digital skills, critical thinking, and the ability to interact with automated systems will be essential in the labor market over the next decade (Singla et al., 2025).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study proposes a new concept that explains the modern technological change: technology invasiveness that breaks into a scientific and technological ecosystem, with accelerated diffusion of large quantities of products leading to main change in the innovation ecotone that transfers knowledge and know-how in businesses and markets. Invasive technologies conquer scientific, technological and business space of alternative technologies and expand the knowledge space of adjacent possible by introducing radical innovations that support dynamic interactions between new technologies and emerging development and applications. This theoretical approach is empirically verified in emerging path-breaking technology of transformer, a deep learning architecture having unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms that create new contents and mimics human ability (Generative Artificial Intelligence). Statistical evidence here, based on patent analyses, reveals that the growth rate of transformer technology is 55.82% (over 2016-2023) more than double compared to 23.02% of all other technologies, such as Convolutional Neural Network: it is force that is revolutionizing the way societies interact with machines. Hence invasive technologies are considered as one of the major causes of global technological change and this study offers a profound exploration of how invasive technologies drive technological change, significantly contributing to our understanding of technological evolution’s dynamics and its societal and industry impacts.</jats:p>",
